			We have a new LPU assignment available to you and your team. This PU, designated LPU-1031, was
			discovered during the maiden deployment of the latest Lost Pocket Universe Recovery Robot,
			LPURR-40, or “Juniper”.
		</p>

		<p>
			June’s latest report indicates no dangers or hazards encountered in this LPU (so far). We
			invite your team to accept this high-priority assignment to further explore and document
			LPU-1031, and to provide an LPUR after you have completed your findings.
		</p>

		<p>
			For acceptance of this assignment, please respond to this ARL within two weeks of reception.

		<p>The full briefing is attached.</p>

		<p>Temperate regards,</p>
